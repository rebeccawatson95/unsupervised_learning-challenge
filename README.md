#### Project Background:
You are on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Your team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

You have been provided with raw data, so you’ll first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. You will use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.

#### Findings:
I applied what I learned about unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, I created a visualization that shares my findings.

I was able to:
- Prepare the Data
- Apply Dimensionality Reduction
- Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means
- Make a Recommendation
