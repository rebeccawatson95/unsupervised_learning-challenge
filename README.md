# unsupervised_learning-challenge
# Rebecca Watson

I applied what I learned about unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, I created a visualization that shares my findings.

I was able to:
1. Prepare the Data
2. Apply Dimensionality Reduction
3. Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means
4. Make a Recommendation
